— Eren explains why he was compelled to move forward[31]
Eren Yeager (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the Survey Corps. He was the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District with his parents until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan.[32] This event would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.[33]

Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Yeager, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria.[34] He then injected Eren with a Titan serum.[34]
    <ul>
    	<li>Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. His facial features strongly resembled his mother's; he had a reasonably long, rounded face and sizable, expressive, gray eyes. His hair was short and black, and his bangs fell in a natural, middle-parted, curtain-type style. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular, although this was often unseen due to his relatively baggy clothing.[39] After the four-year time skip, Eren grew his hair down to his neck.</li>
        <li>Eren was first seen wearing typical townsfolk attire that consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a reddish-brown coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a black scarf, which he gave to Mikasa Ackerman the day they met. As a teenager, he was often seen in the typical Survey Corps uniform while training. His casual attire consisted of a long beige shirt identical to the one he wore in his first appearance, a maroon sash around his waist, white trousers, and brown knee-high boots. He always kept the key given to him by his father dangling around his neck on a string.</li>

	    		To structure a document, HTML5 uses elements like:
	    		<ul>
	    			<li>"div"</li>
	    			<li>"header"</li>
	    			<li>"section"</li>
	    			<li>"body"</li>
	    			<li>"heading"</li>
			    </ul>
	    		HTML5 uses the "input" tag to allow users to input information. It has many different types, including:
				<ul>
					<li>Color</li>
					<li>Date</li>
					<li>Datetime-local</li>
					<li>Email</li>
					<li>Number</li>
					<li>Range</li>
					<li>Search</li>
					<li>URL</li>
